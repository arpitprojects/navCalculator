Create a simple Front end form which takes date and invested amount as a parameter and computes the investment
 value as of today. For example, If I had invested Rs. 10,000 in Axis Long Term Equity Fund - 
 Direct Plan on 13/May/2016, when the NAV value was 26.5481, I would have purchased 376.67 Units. 
 That investment today would be worth Rs. 12,517 (on 15'th Jun).

To achieve the above you would need to download the entire NAV history of a given fund. 
You can download complete NAV history of a mutual fund house from here 
http://portal.amfiindia.com/DownloadNAVHistoryReport_Po.aspx?mf=53&tp=1&frmdt=01-Apr-2015&todt=07-Aug-2017
The URL above is for Axis Mutual fund.

Constraints
1. You can chose to work with only one Fund or one Fund house
2. Assume all investment happened after 01-Apr-2015.

Bonus Points
1. Allow me to add as many purchase records as I can for any date in past. It should show me my current value today.
2. Allow me to select different fund from a fixed fund house.

You can chose a database to store the information or you can use a simple text file to store the NAV's. 
The backend can be as simple as providing the information and the entire logic is in the frontend. 
Please implement the frontend in VueJS so I can sense your grasp in VueJS.
